            My name is Tri Nguyen. I'm a senior web developer for a Web development firm based in Tacoma, Washington. I have been working in the Web development industry for more than 5 years, using the following technology: ASP.NET, ASP.NET MVC, PHP, SQL, MySQL, Jquery, Ajax, XML, JSON, CSS, HTML, and Web Services.

            Recently, I started to explore more about mobile apps development. This is my first Hybrid Application. Originally, my intention was to develop this 
            specifically for my person uses; however, after a few download requests from close buddies, I might as well post it in the market since I've already have an account there.
